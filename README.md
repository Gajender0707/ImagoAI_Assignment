Task for ML Intern
Objective
This assignment assesses your ability to process hyperspectral imaging data, perform dimensionality reduction, and develop a machine learning model to predict mycotoxin levels (e.g., DON concentration) in corn samples.

Problem Statement
You are provided with a compact hyperspectral dataset containing spectral reflectance data from corn samples across multiple wavelength bands. Your task is to:
Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize features).
Visualize spectral bands to explore data characteristics.
Reduce dimensionality using PCA or t-SNE and interpret the results.
Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or a simple neural network) for regression (or classification, if specified).
Evaluate the model and present actionable insights.

Dataset Description
Features: Spectral reflectance values across multiple wavelength bands (columns).
Rows: Individual corn samples.
Target Variable: DON concentration (continuous, for regression).

Tasks
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Load the dataset and inspect for missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.
Apply normalization or standardization to the spectral data as needed.
Visualize spectral bands (e.g., line plots for average reflectance, heatmaps for sample comparisons).
2. Dimensionality Reduction
Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to reduce feature dimensions.
Report the variance explained by the top principal components (for PCA) or clustering patterns (for t-SNE).
Visualize the reduced data (e.g., 2D/3D scatter plots).
3. Model Training
Select a model: Deep Learning, CNN, GNN, or LSTM.
Split the dataset into training (e.g., 80%) and testing (e.g., 20%) sets.
Train the model and optimize hyperparameters (e.g., using grid search or random search).
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate using regression metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RÂ² Score
(If adapted to classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Visualize results:
Scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values (regression).
(Optional) Confusion matrix (classification).
Summarize model performance and limitations.
